### About Shoreline
The Shoreline platform provides real-time monitoring, alerting, and incident automation for cloud operations. Use Shoreline to detect, debug, and automate repairs across your entire fleet in seconds with just a few lines of code.

Shoreline Agents are efficient and non-intrusive processes running in the background of all your monitored hosts. Agents act as the secure link between Shoreline and your environment's Resources, providing real-time monitoring and metric collection across your fleet. Agents can execute actions on your behalf -- everything from simple Linux commands to full remediation playbooks -- running simultaneously across all the targeted Resources.

Since Agents are distributed throughout your fleet and monitor your Resources in real time, when an issue occurs Shoreline automatically alerts your team before your operators notice something is wrong. Plus, when you're ready for it, Shoreline can automatically resolve these issues using Alarms, Actions, Bots, and other Shoreline tools that you configure. These objects work in tandem to monitor your fleet and dispatch the appropriate response if something goes wrong -- you can even receive notifications via the fully-customizable Slack integration.

Shoreline Notebooks let you convert your static runbooks into interactive, annotated, sharable web-based documents. Through a combination of Markdown-based notes and Shoreline's expressive Op language, you have one-click access to real-time, per-second debug data and powerful, fleetwide repair commands.

### What are Shoreline Op Packs?
Shoreline Op Packs are open-source collections of Terraform configurations and supporting scripts that use the Shoreline Terraform Provider and the Shoreline Platform to create turnkey incident automations for common operational issues. Each Op Pack comes with smart defaults and works out of the box with minimal setup, while also providing you and your team with the flexibility to customize, automate, codify, and commit your own Op Pack configurations.

# Generic Title: Host Network Receive Errors
---

Host Network Receive Errors refer to issues where the network interface of a host encounters errors while receiving data. Such errors can cause communication disruptions between different components of a system and may lead to service disruptions or failures. These errors can be caused by various factors, including faulty hardware, network congestion, or software misconfigurations. Resolving these issues requires careful diagnosis and troubleshooting to identify the root cause and implement the necessary fixes.

### Parameters
```shell
export INTERFACE_NAME="PLACEHOLDER"

export HOSTNAME="PLACEHOLDER"

export OUTPUT_FILE="PLACEHOLDER"

export OFFENDING_IP_ADDRESS="PLACEHOLDER"
```

## Debug

### Check network interface statistics:
```shell
ifconfig -a
```

### Identify the interface with errors:
```shell
dmesg | grep ${INTERFACE_NAME}
```

### Check network interface errors:
```shell
ethtool -S ${INTERFACE_NAME}
```

### Check network interface hardware issues:
```shell
ethtool -t ${INTERFACE_NAME}
```

### Check network interface configuration:
```shell
cat /etc/network/interfaces
```

### Check system logs for any relevant messages:
```shell
dmesg | tail
```

### Check system load:
```shell
top
```

### Check network connectivity:
```shell
ping ${HOSTNAME}
```

### Check network latency:
```shell
traceroute ${HOSTNAME}
```

### Check network throughput:
```shell
iperf -c ${HOSTNAME}
```

### Check network packet loss:
```shell
mtr ${HOSTNAME}
```

### Check for any open network connections:
```shell
netstat -a
```

### Check for any firewall rules:
```shell
iptables -L
```

### Check system resource utilization:
```shell
vmstat
```

### Check disk space utilization:
```shell
df -h
```

### Network congestion: Heavy network traffic or network congestion can cause Host Network Receive Errors.
```shell


#!/bin/bash



# Set the network interface to diagnose (replace ${INTERFACE_NAME} with the actual interface name)

INTERFACE_NAME=${INTERFACE_NAME}



# Check the current network traffic on the interface

TRAFFIC=$(ifconfig $INTERFACE_NAME | grep "RX packets" | awk '{print $5}')



# Check the current number of errors on the interface

ERRORS=$(ifconfig $INTERFACE_NAME | grep "RX errors" | awk '{print $2}')



# Check if the number of errors is increasing rapidly

if [ $ERRORS -gt 0 ]; then

    ERROR_RATE=$((ERRORS*100/TRAFFIC))

    if [ $ERROR_RATE -gt 5 ]; then

        echo "Network congestion may be causing Host Network Receive Errors on $INTERFACE_NAME"

    else

        echo "Errors on $INTERFACE_NAME are within normal range"

    fi

else

    echo "No errors found on $INTERFACE_NAME"

fi


```

## Repair

### Perform a network trace or packet capture to identify any malicious or abnormal network traffic that may be causing the receive errors. Block or quarantine the offending traffic as necessary.
```shell


#!/bin/bash



# Install tcpdump command if not installed

if ! command -v tcpdump &> /dev/null

then

    sudo apt-get update

    sudo apt-get install tcpdump -y

fi



# Perform network trace or packet capture

sudo tcpdump -i ${INTERFACE_NAME} -w ${OUTPUT_FILE}.pcap



# Analyze network capture using Wireshark

wireshark ${OUTPUT_FILE}.pcap &



# Block or quarantine offending traffic

sudo iptables -A INPUT -s ${OFFENDING_IP_ADDRESS} -j DROP


```
